Once upon a time there lived a monkey on the jamoon tree near the bank of a river.
He used to live there and eat jamoons everyday.

There also lived a crocodile in the river with his wife


One day crocodile saw the monkey playing on the tree, he went near to him and asked him to be his friend.
The monkey agreed happily. Soon they became good firends, monkey used to give jamoons to crocodile everyday.
